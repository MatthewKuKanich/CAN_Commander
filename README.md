# CAN Commander: CAN Bus Reverse Engineering Tool

## Introduction
CAN Commander is a comprehensive tool designed for the reverse engineering of CAN (Controller Area Network) bus systems. This project aims to provide a robust platform for automotive enthusiasts, engineers, and security researchers to interact with and analyze CAN networks, facilitating a deeper understanding and manipulation of vehicular communication systems.

## Features
- **Message Injection**: Send custom CAN messages to test responses from different modules.
- **Message Logging**: Record and log CAN traffic for analysis.
- **Network Sniffing**: Monitor the CAN network to observe communication between different components.
- **Message Decoding**: Decode CAN messages and understand the underlying data structures.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Capabilities**: Use as a set and forget MITM device to do in-place packet swapping.
- **User-friendly Interface**: An intuitive interface for interacting with the CAN network. -App Version
- **Real-time Data Visualization**: Graphical representation of the CAN traffic for easier analysis.
- **DTC and Diagnostics**: Get all the features of a standard OBDII PID scanner
- **Wireless Options**: Communicate via wire tap, WiFi, or Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE)

## Getting Started
To get started with CAN Commander, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Next install autowp's mcp2515 library: https://github.com/autowp/arduino-mcp2515

2. **Setup and Installation**:
   1. **Flashing the Main Application**:
      - The core of CAN Commander is the `CAN_Commander.ino` script.
      - This script must be flashed onto a compatible microcontroller like Arduino Uno, Mega, or Nano using the Arduino IDE.

   2. **MCP2515 CAN Controller**:
      - The MCP2515 is a CAN (Controller Area Network) controller that interfaces with microcontrollers over SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface).
      - It typically comes as a breakout board which you need to connect to your microcontroller.
    
       - Connect the MCP2515's MOSI, MISO, SCK, and CS pins to the corresponding SPI pins on the Arduino. **Please Verify for your Arduino**
       - For Arduino Uno, Mega, and Nano, the SPI pins are usually located as follows:
          - **MOSI**: Pin 11
          - **MISO**: Pin 12
          - **SCK**: Pin 13
          - **CS**: Pin 10 (You can use other digital pins, but Pin 10 is standard for most libraries)

**Using 3.3V Logic Microcontrollers**
- If you're using a microcontroller like the ESP32 or Raspberry Pi Pico, which operate at 3.3V logic, you need a level shifter.
- The level shifter will convert the 5V signals from the MCP2515 to 3.3V, making it safe to connect to these microcontrollers.

**Optional: Mobile App**
    In addition to the main `CAN_Commander.ino` application, there is also a mobile app available. This is not the main application and is optional. If you choose to use it, you can find the source code in the `AndroidEnvironment/CANCommanderApp_BLE_Edition` and `AndroidEnvironment/CANCommanderApp_WiFi_Edition` directories.
    1. **Running the Tool**:
    - Flash CAN_WiFi to an ESP32 or WiFi enabled Arduino

## Usage
- **Basic Operations**:
  - **Reading ALL CAN data:** Input `1` into the terminal to start reading all CAN traffic. You can input `a` to convert the received message data into *ASCII*.
    
  - **Filter and Read:** Input `4` into the terminal, then input a **Filter Mask** in *HEX*, finally input the **Frame ID** you want to filter and hit enter.
    
  - **Sending CAN messages:** Input `2` into the terminal, then input the **Frame ID** you want for your message, next input the data of the message in **HEX** format. Then specify the send/message frequency of your frame in messages per second. (Input `5` to send 5 messages per second)
    
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Detailed guide still in the works

## Hardware Requirements
- Microcontroller (Arduino Uno, Mega, Nano, Pico, ESP8266, ESP32)
- MCP2515 (Make sure you verify the crystal 8/16/etc)
